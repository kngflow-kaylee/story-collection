# StoryPress – Short Story Showcase

StoryPress is a modern, news‑style short story collection built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  
It demonstrates a clean fixed‑sidebar layout, responsive two‑column grid, modal story excerpts, category navigation, ad tiles, a newsletter signup section, and a smooth “Back to Top” button.

This project is front‑end only and designed for layout demonstration, UI polish, and interactive component testing.
